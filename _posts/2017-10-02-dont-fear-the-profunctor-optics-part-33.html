<p>Once we've seen concrete optics and profunctors, it's time to introduce the last installment of this series: <a href="https://github.com/hablapps/DontFearTheProfunctorOptics/blob/master/ProfunctorOptics.md">Profunctor Optics</a>. Here, we'll see how to encode optics in a profunctor representation, which takes composability to the next level. As usual, your feedback is welcome!</p>
