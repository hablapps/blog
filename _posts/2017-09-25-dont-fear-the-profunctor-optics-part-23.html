<p>As promised, here it is the second installment of our series on profunctor optics: <a href="https://github.com/hablapps/DontFearTheProfunctorOptics/blob/master/Profunctors.md">Profunctors as Generalized Functions</a>. Today, we'll introduce several members of the profunctor family (<code>Cartesian</code>, <code>Monoidal</code>, etc.) and we'll provide their corresponding diagrams, to make them more approachable.</p>
