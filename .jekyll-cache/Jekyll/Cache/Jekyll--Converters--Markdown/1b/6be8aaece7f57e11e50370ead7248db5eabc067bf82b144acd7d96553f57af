I"`<p>Here it is our new blog post, as a sequel of <a href="https://blog.hablapps.com/2016/11/10/lens-state-is-your-father/">Lens, State Is Your Father</a>. Today, we’ll try to formalize some informal claims that we did in that article and we’ll emphasize on the relevance of proof assistants in functional programming. We’ve decided to <a href="https://github.com/hablapps/LensStateIsYourFather">publish the content of this post as a GitHub repo</a>, to get a better formatting of <em>Coq</em> snippets (so please, feel free to send your pull requests to improve it). As usual, we hope you like it!</p>
