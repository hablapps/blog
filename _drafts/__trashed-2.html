<p>This blog being named purely functional has to say something about ... monads or purely functional programming, in general. In the next posts we will unveil our experience on using purely functional programming, and we will write about monads. But why new posts about monads? Three distinctive features:</p>
<p>1) construction by necessity. First, state the problem, then the solution, so that the construction monad or whatever that we are discussing is the constructed solution.</p>
<p>2) no endogamic descriptions. This means that the solution will be compared to the mainstream object-oriented solution your are most used to.</p>
<p>3) Multilanguage. The default language is our beloved Scala, but we will also speak about F# and Java8.</p>

<li>Functional spark: it's not all about monads</li>
<li>Purely functional play controllers</li>
</ul>
<p>But too much emphasis is given to monads. Indeed, the purpose of this series of posts is not to write about monads, but about the more general field of purely functional programming. and eventually, to show you why functional programming matters? There was a nice article with this title written by John Hughes in the beginning of 90s, and it seems more relevant than ever now. However, at that time, monads were just a baby within the field of computer science, and the paper just didn't show enough attention to this fact.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
