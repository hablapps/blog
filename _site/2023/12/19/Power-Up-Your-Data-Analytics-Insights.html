            <h1 id="kx-insights-simplifying-data-analytics">KX Insights: Simplifying Data Analytics</h1>

<p>This post serves as a concise exploration of the versatile capabilities within <a href="https://kx.com/products/kdb-insights/"><strong>KX Insights</strong></a>, highlighting its role as the premier cloud-based platform for efficient time series analysis. Leveraging the robust capabilities of kdb+ vector databases, this tool stands out not only for its exceptional speed but also for empowering users— particularly those without advanced technical expertise— to seamlessly develop data ingestion processes, query engines, and visualizations. The post will be structured as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="#use-case">Use Case</a>: Delving into a specific use case, we will employ an illustrative example using telecommunication network data. This section aims to explain the kind of data we start with and the functionality we want to derive from it.</p>

</blockquote>

<h1 id="use-case">Use Case</h1>

<p>Let’s consider a scenario where we are a telecommunications (telco) company deeply involved in the dynamic world of high-density real-time telco data. In this situation, our goal is to empower our Data Team with a robust system for in-depth data analysis and insightful conclusions. The provided data have several fields that will be explained deeply in a <a href="#deploying-the-database">later</a> section, but to ilustrate the use case we can preview some available records:</p>

<p>Basically, these records show information about calls from users located at a certain longitude and latitude, through a specific cell of the telecommunication network. To analyse this data, we will create comprehensive dashboards that visually represent key metrics. We have identified specific elements that will be pivotal in enhancing our operational understanding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User Distribution Heatmap</strong>: Our objective is to gain insights into the geographical distribution of our users in real-time. The User Distribution Heatmap within KX Insights will vividly illustrate the concentration of our current users, allowing us to promptly identify high-demand areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Network Performance Analysis (Line Graph)</strong>: Understanding the impact of network density on speed is critical for ensuring a seamless user experience. Through KX Insights, we plan to deploy a Line Graph that dynamically illustrates network upload and download speed variability, enabling proactive optimization of our network performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User Location Tracker</strong>: The ability to locate users within a specific geography is essential for targeted interventions and optimizations. KX Insights will provide real-time information on the geographical whereabouts of our users, facilitating strategic decision-making.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure Analysis TreeMap</strong>: Identifying and resolving issues promptly is key to maintaining a high-quality service. A TreeMap, powered by KX Insights, will pinpoint users experiencing difficulties with their connection, enabling us to swiftly address issues and ensure a seamless communication experience for our users.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For our development journey, we’ve chosen to leverage the use case outlined earlier for two compelling reasons: the data’s temporal nature, allowing for the utilization of time series analysis tools, and its high density. By doing so, we aim not only to demonstrate the prowess of KX Insights but also to shed light on the underlying machinery powering it—the kdb+ database.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ℹ️ <em>Please note that the data presented is specifically crafted for this illustrative example and does not originate from real telecommunication sources.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="was-it-always-this-easy">Was it Always This Easy?</h1>

<p>Our decision to use KX Insights for implementing the use case described in the last section is driven not only by the nature of our data, characterized by a vast volume of real-time information, but also by the platform’s exceptional capabilities in constructing functional pipelines, executing complex queries, and delivering compelling visualizations. To appreciate these capabilities, let’s suppose we would need to construct a similar architecture using only kdb+/q and other KX tools. Then, the question arises: How challenging would this endeavor be? Here, we succinctly outline some of the crucial steps that should be undertaken:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build a Kafka Consumer:</strong> Constructing a Kafka consumer entails delving into the <a href="https://github.com/KxSystems/kafka">API</a>, understanding its intricacies, and developing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate seamless data consumption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Orchestrate the Pipeline:</strong> Docking the pipeline involves implementing all the transformations essential for processing real-time data. This step requires careful consideration and meticulous execution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Develop Graphic Tools:</strong> While the <a href="https://code.kx.com/analyst/libraries/grammar-of-graphics/"><em>Grammar of Graphics</em></a> package is a powerful tool, we would still need to create a system for visualizing the aggregated data. We could use <a href="https://code.kx.com/dashboards/">KX Dashboards</a> to power this process, but we would still have two different applications, potentially leading to IPC technical specification challenges.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond these tasks, there’s the challenge of working with an event handler for streaming data, which is not always straightforward. Additionally, packaging all these components into a black-box-like application is necessary to empower the entire data team to work with it, regardless of their technical expertise. Moreover, generalizing this solution for any conceivable use case poses an even more significant undertaking.</p>

<p>The solution presented in this post using <a href="https://kx.com/products/kdb-insights-enterprise/">KX Insights Enterprise</a> wraps all this complexity in a user-friendly web interface, eliminating the need for the data team to possess intricate technical knowledge. To walk the reader through this tool as easily as possible, we will follow the recommended steps of KX Insights, which can be seen in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/overview.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="deploying-the-database">Deploying the database</h3>

<p>Once we have accessed the <strong>Build a Database</strong> tab, we can configure it to suit our specific needs. For simplicity, we will leave the technical specifications (memory, storage, etc.) at their default settings, thus avoiding delving into unnecessary technical details.</p>

<p>Our database (which we will name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db-telco</code>) will include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> table. This table is where real-time telephony data will be stored (and from where the heatmap, tracker, and volume views will capture the data). It will have 10 columns, as seen in the records example, which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts</code>: The timestamp of the network trace for the record (timestamp type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cellID</code>: The ID of the cell on which the trace is being transmitted (symbol type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase</code>: Indicates the data source’s release stage (int type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imsi</code>: The ID of the SIM card participating in the trace (string type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imei</code>: The ID of the device participating in the trace (string type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dspeed</code>: The download speed of the network for this particular event (float type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uspeed</code>: The upload speed of the network for this particular event (float type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lat</code>: The latitude of the device from which the event is taking place (float type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lng</code>: The longitude of the device from which the event is taking place (float type).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cellDistance</code>: The distance to the cell of the device (float type).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/schema_main.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After creating the schemas for the table, we save and click on <strong>Deploy</strong>, and with that, we have the database up and running!</p>

<h3 id="data-slide-the-pipeline">Data slide: the pipeline</h3>

<p>When it comes to data ingestion, pipelines are employed. The tools provided by KX Insights Enterprise for the creation, analysis, and testing of pipelines are extensive and straightforward to use, as we will see below. Constructing the pipelines using the web interface (i.e., going to <em>Import Data</em> in the Overview window) is pretty straightforward and gives us a basic pipeline that will have four fundamental parts, which can then be further complicated or supplemented with others, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reader:</strong> The reader for Insights pipelines is highly versatile, allowing data ingestion from multiple sources, as depicted in the image below.</li>
  <li><strong>Decoder:</strong> The decoder, responsible for transforming data received through the reader from different formats (JSON, CSV, etc.) into a q datatype.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply Schema:</strong> Shapes the incoming data through ingestion. It can be any type of data, tabular, or an array.</li>
  <li><strong>Writer:</strong> This last component, as its name suggests, is responsible for writing the received data into a table in a previously created database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s create a pipeline for the ingestion of telephone data, provided by a Kafka service. To achieve this, having chosen Kafka as the data source (selecting the corresponding broker and topic), JSON as the decoder, the schema of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> table seen earlier, and writing to that table, we end up with the following:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/basic_ppline.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We will be writing in a database stored in the KX Insights architecture, but this is not the only place we can store the captured data. Some of the other options are a Kafka Topic, Amazon S3, and more. If you want to delve deeper into the pipeline operators, you can refer to the <a href="https://code.kx.com/insights/1.8/enterprise/ingest/pipeline/operators/index.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Before having a functional pipeline, a couple of things need to be done.</p>

<p>Firstly, as we are getting JSON-format data, we will have to decode it. The data arriving through the Decoder is in dictionary format (as is the main approach for JSON data), but the Apply Schema expects tables. We need to transform the data, which can be easily done through an additional intermediate step. Particularly, let’s use the dropdown on the left, looking for the Map cell. Map applies the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map()</code> function to the incoming data, transforming all data in the stream. In this case, as the output of the Decoder is a dictionary, and a table is expected, the only function to apply to the data is the q <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enlist</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ℹ️ <em>This step must be included because the captured data is in JSON format. If we would have CSV-like streaming data, we wouldn’t need to transform it to tables, as the usual interpretation of CSV is table-like.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/basic_ppline_map.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Additionally, considering the potentially high data density, it is advisable to incorporate an intermediate step before writing to the database – an Apply function. This function facilitates a gradual transfer of data to the writing process at a more measured pace, storing it in batches. By minimizing the frequency of database writer calls, we mitigate the risk of efficiency reduction. This practice is recommended to prevent component overload, which could otherwise result in processes being terminated due to out-of-memory (OOM) issues. It’s worth noting that this technique is commonly employed in other platforms for real-time data ingestion, underscoring its effectiveness and reliability.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/basic_ppline_apply.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The magic of Insights lies precisely in the fact that, with a minimal amount of code, we have managed to deploy a real-time massive data ingestion pipeline. You don’t always need to be technical to work with data!</p>

<h3 id="querying-the-data">Querying the data</h3>

<p>We will need to understand how the data is stored to query it effectively. KX Insights supports three types of storage tiers: <strong>RDB, IDB, and HDB</strong>, each with specific characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RDB stores only real-time data, with just a small amount of timelapse.</li>
  <li>IDB stores data as intervals from real time, and from time to time, the pipeline will send a signal indicating either the start or the end of a new interval, and then all the data will be stored in IDB as batches.</li>
  <li>HDB stores historical data. Once enough time has passed since the data was stored in IDB, it moves directly to be stored in HDB.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the streaming data will go through <strong>RDB → IDB → HDB</strong>. As we are doing a real-time process, we will primarily work with RDB, as we will see briefly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ℹ️ <em>If you want to know more about the different storage tiers, please check the <a href="https://code.kx.com/insights/1.8/microservices/database/storage/tiers.html">documentation</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To examine the data, let’s navigate to the “Query” section, where we will encounter something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/query_basic.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once here, we have three options for querying the data: using the API, employing SQL, or utilizing q. By using q, we can perform various transformations with simple commands, so let’s proceed with it. As we observed in the pipeline, we are storing the data in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> table and querying from its stream tier <em>rdb</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/query1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can even do a little analysis of the speed of the network data using the “Visual” window below, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/query2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And also, using PyKX, we can check the different statistics of the table as easily as working with Pandas!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/query3.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="enjoying-the-views">Enjoying the views</h3>

<p>Now that we have stored the data, what about analyzing it? This section allows us to create dashboards with the data we are ingesting through the pipeline and analyze it in several ways! The interface is pretty similar to the one our colleague Óscar explained in <a href="https://www.habla.dev/blog/2023/10/03/Exploring-KX-Dashboards.html">this post</a>, so we are skipping most of the setup part. Nevertheless, there are two things that may have to be explained:</p>

<h5 id="stream-connectors">Stream Connectors</h5>

<p>As in the dashboards post, when you declare a view in KX Insights, you have to create a data source that will ingest data from a database. As mentioned before, Insights has three different default databases: RDB, IDB, and HDB. As we are analyzing real-time data, most of the time we will ingest from RDB, as seen below (image from heatmap datasource).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/views_sources.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Also, as in the query engine, you can just use the Insights API to query the data from any of those databases, as you can see in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/views_api.png" alt="" /></p>

<h5 id="heatmap">Heatmap</h5>

<p>First, we have created a heatmap that updates in real-time. This innovative heatmap dynamically illustrates user density across, in this case, Chicago. This live update feature ensures that the data displayed is always current, providing an accurate and up-to-the-minute view of network performance. This information enables us to optimize network coverage and capacity where it’s most needed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/heatmap_gr.png" alt="" /></p>

<h5 id="speed">Speed</h5>

<p>We have also created a dashboard where we plot both the upload and download speeds of different connections in real-time. This gives us information about how our network is working in general terms. In essence, this speed tracking dashboard is a key component in our toolkit, enabling us to continuously monitor and improve the overall health and performance of our network.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/volumes.png" alt="" /></p>

<h5 id="tracker">Tracker</h5>

<p>We have created a dashboard that acts as a tracker, allowing us to follow the locations of the different connections that the user makes. It maps out the geographical journey of users by pinpointing where and when they establish network connections. This level of detailed tracking is invaluable for understanding user mobility and network usage patterns.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/tracker_zoomed.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Up until now, our data ingestion has revolved around high-density, real-time data utilizing the fundamental modules offered by KX Insights Enterprise. Moreover, we’ve successfully illuminated the insights derived from this data through the integration of Dashboards. Consequently, the inquiry arises: how can we further enhance this process?</p>

<h2 id="the-hardest-the-easiest">The hardest; the easiest</h2>

<p>We have ingested and queried our data, and everything is working quite well. Why don’t we make it a little trickier? In this section, we will briefly comment on a little upgrade to the pipeline built in the previous one, following the same structure (i.e., database → pipeline → query → dashboard). Shall we begin?</p>

<p>Let’s create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">errs</code> table. This new table will be used for a subsequent grouping to study errors in the network (and assist users with the highest error rates). It will have three fields (we have already seen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imsi</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count0</code>: This counts the errors that have occurred in the network in the grouping (int type).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/schema_errs.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Presently, our focus shifts towards storing data in this context. The collection of information concerning users with the highest error rates holds significant utility for promptly addressing their concerns, resolving issues, and maintaining client satisfaction. This entails bifurcating our data stream into two distinct segments: the previously highlighted stream that populates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> table, and the one under consideration here. To facilitate error storage, we intend to aggregate the data, aiming for the utmost precision in error-related information.</p>

<p>To aggregate the data, we will use a new module:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Timer Window</em>: This one will store the streaming data by a specified time (in this case, 1 minute).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once our <em>Timer Window</em> has stored the last minute of data, we will aggregate it using a <em>Map</em>. The map function will aggregate by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imsi</code>, counting the times that the speed of some user is lower than a given threshold.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0!select count0: count i by imsi, ts from data where uspeed &lt; avg[uspeed] | dspeed &lt; avg[dspeed] </code></p>

<p>Once done so, we will store our data in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">errs</code> table. Using <em>Apply Schema</em> again will work out.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/pipelineComplex.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As we can see, repeated modules have the same name, with a numeric identification. To change it for clarity, we can <strong>Right Click</strong> → <strong>Rename Node</strong> and write down the desired name for each node. Then, we would have our pipeline finished, as something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023/12/19/pipelineComplexFinal.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having established our pipeline for loading the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">errs</code> table with data, the subsequent step involves verification to ensure its functionality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to return to the query engine and modify our code statement accordingly, querying from the newly created table to assess its operational status.</p>

<p>And <em>voilà</em>, we have our high error rate users stored!</p>

<p>To visualize the errors, we have created a treemap where we represent the users who have experienced the most errors in the last few minutes. By categorizing and visualizing the errors encountered by our users, this treemap enables us to quickly identify and address the most common and pressing issues. This dashboard does not use the RDB but the IDB in order to aggregate through more time, so we are always aware of the last-minute state of user experience, allowing for swift and proactive interventions.</p>
