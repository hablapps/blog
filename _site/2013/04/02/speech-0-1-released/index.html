<meta name="description" content="We are happy to announce the first release of the Speech interpreter. This is a beta release with the minimum functionality required to test significant application examples, demonstrate the virtues of the Speech DSL and ... receive feedback from you! You can download the interpreter from the Speech Community Portal: There you will also find instructions to run the interpreter, a short presentation of Speech, a first version of the user guide to Speech programming in Scala, and links to prototype applications. Parts of the Speech interpreter were already open sourced (particularly, the updatable package), and we aim at publishing other major modules of the interpreter in the near future. Admittedly, documentation is far from being complete, so our purpose now is mainly showing you what a Speech program looks like. We expect to give you soon a full-fledge documentation including the Speech API and a design guide in order to allow you to become a proficient Speech programmer. In the meantime, we have planned a series of blog posts focusing in different application domains. And the first program that we will use to exemplify Speech will be ... the &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program, of course. I hope you like it!" />
